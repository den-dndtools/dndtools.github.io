<h2>Kineticist</h2>

<p>(<a href="../rulebook/web-30--160/index.html">Web 3.0</a> variant, p. None)</p>


<div class="nice-textile">
	<p>A kineticist is a character that has discovered that a little psionic power goes a long way &#8212; if you are interested in only a single type of psionic energy, that is. Kineticists focus all of their attention to a single type of psionic energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) while giving up access to all other types.</p>

	<p>A kineticist who focuses on fire is known as a pyrokineticist or &quot;pyro,&quot; while one who focuses on cold is called a cryokineticist or &quot;cryo,&quot; acid is a acetokineticist or &quot;aceto,&quot; sonic energy is a sonokineticist or &quot;sono,&quot; and electricity is a electrokineticist or &quot;electro.&quot; Any character with some psionic ability is a possible candidate for this prestige class. Psions and psychic warriors consider it acceptable to give up power acquisition in other areas if they have the passion for a specific type of energy.</p>

    <h4>Class Features</h4>
    
        	<p>All of the following are class features of the kineticist prestige class.</p>

	<p><strong>Armor and Weapon Proficiency:</strong> Kineticists gain proficiency in whip <em>energy lash</em> at 2nd level. They gain no other proficiency in any armor or weapons, though they retain any knowledge gained from former classes.</p>

	<p><strong>Power Points:</strong> At 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 10th levels the kineticist gains power points as though she gained a level of psion. These power points are added to the character&#39;s previous total. Kineticists gain bonus power points based on the key ability score for their primary ability. If the character previously could not gain bonus power points for high ability scores (as is the case for psychic warriors), she now chooses a primary discipline and can gain bonus power points based on the related ability score.</p>

	<p><strong>Powers Discovered:</strong> At 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 10th levels, the kineticist discovers powers as though she gained a level of psion. Powers are chosen from the psion power list. When choosing a power that falls outside her primary discipline but that possesses an energy type descriptor that matches her chosen energy type, she does not need to meet the minimum required key ability score to manifest these powers since these powers now use the kineticist&#39;s primary ability as their key ability. The kineticist&#39;s effective manifester level is increased by one for each level of the prestige class.</p>

	<p><strong>Psionic Combat:</strong> Psionic attack and defense modes are discovered as though the character were a psychic warrior of the same level as the prestige class. (Characters do not forget previously discovered attack and defense modes.)</p>

	<p><strong>Psicrystals:</strong> Kineticist levels count toward the level of the psionic character for determining psicrystal Intelligence and special abilities. Characters whose previous class did not offer access to a psicrystal (such as psychic warrior) gain the ability to create one as a psion can.</p>

	<p><strong>0-Level Powers:</strong> Kineticist levels count toward the level of the psionic character for determining the number of free manifestations per day or your 0-level powers.</p>

	<p><strong>Chosen Energy Type:</strong> Upon gaining this prestige class, the kineticist chooses a type of psionic energy to focus all of her attention on. Choose one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. All powers that the kineticist knows with a psionic energy designator are modified to use the chosen type of energy instead. The power works normally in all respects except the type of damage dealt. All other abilities of this prestige class also follow the type of energy focus chosen. When using <a href="../../feats/web-30--160/psionic-energy-admixture--3807/index.html">Psionic Energy Admixture</a>, it is not forbidden for a kineticist to use another type of psionic energy; however few kineticists would even consider it.</p>

	<p>The visible display of powers and abilities is modified as follows. The associated color changes (acid/green, cold/blue, electricity/purple, fire/red, sonic/yellow). They may also have additional effects such as burning flames for fire, mist or ice shards for cold, billowing mist and sizzling for acid, a low-pitched hum and rippled air effect for sonic, and arcs of electricity and a crackling sound for electricity. For example, an Electricity Nimbus would be a swirling purple field with crackling arcs of electricity. The changed displays should be worked out with your DM.</p>

	<p><strong>Energy Focus (Ex):</strong> At 1st level the kineticist learns to better manipulate the psionic energies of her chosen type. The save DC for any energy-based power that she manifests is increased by +1. This rises to +2 at 5th level, and +3 at 9th level. These increases are cumulative with those granted by the <a href="../../feats/psionics-handbook-30--46/psionic-focus--3784/index.html">Psionic Focus</a> and <a href="../../feats/psionics-handbook-30--46/greater-psionic-focus--1293/index.html">Greater Psionic Focus</a> feats. Energy focus also affects the save DC of all kineticist special abilities that have a saving throw.</p>

	<p><strong>Energized Touch (Su):</strong> A kineticist&#39;s mere touch can affect foes or objects. This is treated as an armed attack and deals 1d4 points of damage of the appropriate energy type, then dissipates. Unarmed attacks deal this damage in addition to their normal damage. The kineticist can use this ability at will as long as her power point reserve is 1 or more.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Energy Barrier</em> (Sp):</strong> At 2nd level, the kineticist can activate an <em>energy barrier</em> as a move-equivalent action. Once activated, this ability grants her a resistance of 5 to attacks of her chosen energy type (you ignore 5 points of damage from the chosen type of energy source). Once the ability has prevented a total of 75 points of damage from the specified energy type, it is discharged. Whenever she absorbs damage, she radiates visible light for a number of rounds equal to the points of damage she successfully ignores. The light is strong enough to illuminate a 60-foot-radius area. The ability can be used once per day and lasts for 1 hour per manifester level or until discharged. This ability is similar to the <em>energy barrier</em> power. This ability cannot be used in conjunction with the <em>energy barrier</em> power. A character can use this ability as long as her power point reserve is 5 or more.</p>

	<p>At 4th level, the resistance rises to 10, the barrier can absorb up to 150 points of damage from the specified energy type, and the power point reserve to use this ability is increased to 9.</p>

	<p>At 6th level, the resistance rises to 15, the barrier can absorb up to 225 points of damage from the specified energy type, and the power point reserve to use this ability is increased to 13.</p>

	<p>At 8th level, the resistance rises to 20, the barrier can absorb up to 300 points of damage from the specified energy type, and the power point reserve to use this ability is increased to 17.</p>

	<p>At 10th level, the barrier can absorb all damage of the chosen energy type up to 500 points, and the power point reserve to use this ability is increased to 21.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Energize Weapon</em> (Sp):</strong> At 2nd level, the kineticist can activate this ability as a move-equivalent action. One weapon she holds is bathed in psionic energy that harms neither her nor the weapon. The weapon deals +1d6 points of damage of the appropriate energy type, in addition to its normal damage. (Projectile weapons bestow this damage on their ammunition.) The weapon remains energized until the kineticist releases it or dismisses it as a free action. A character can use this ability at will as long as her power point reserve is 9 or more.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Energy Lash</em> (Sp):</strong> At 3rd level, the kineticist can fashion a 15-foot-long whip from unstable ectoplasm as a move-equivalent action. She takes no damage from <em>energy lash</em> she creates, and if she releases her hold, it immediately dissipates. The lash deals 1d4 points of energy damage of the appropriate type to the target on a successful ranged touch attack (up to 15 feet). The kineticist can take Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization (if of the appropriate class), or Weapon Finesse feats in conjunction with the <em>energy lash</em>, as well as feats for a standard whip. She can use the <em>energy lash</em> ability at will as long as her power point reserve is 11 or more.</p>

	<p>When activating this ability the kineticist can infuse the <em>energy lash</em> with additional psionic energy, increasing the damage done by +1d4 points per power point spent. The total amount of energy spent infusing an <em>energy lash</em> cannot exceed half your level of kineticist (maximum damage 6d4). The defender may make a Fortitude save (DC 1d20 + 1/2 manifester level, + key ability modifier) for half damage. This increased damage value lasts for a single attack before returning to normal. You can infuse multiple attacks in the same round.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Bolt of Energy</em> (Sp):</strong> At 4th level, the kineticist can launch a bolt of psionic energy up to 60 feet at any target in line of sight. This ability is treated as a ranged touch attack and deals 3d6 points damage of the appropriate type. A character can use this ability at will as long as her power point reserve is 19 or more.</p>

	<p>When activating this ability, the kineticist can infuse the bolt with additional psionic energy, increasing the damage done by +1d6 points per power point spent. The total amount of energy spent infusing the attack cannot exceed your level of kineticist (maximum damage 11d6). The defender may make a Fortitude save (DC 1d20 + 1/2 manifester level + key ability modifier) for half damage. This increased damage value lasts for a single attack.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Energy Breath</em> (Sp):</strong> On reaching 5th level, the kineticist gains a breath weapon that can be used for free once per day. The kineticist can activate this ability additional times per day at the cost of 13 power points per use. This ability is similar to the <em>breath of the dragon</em> power except that the breath extends out in a 60-foot cone that inflicts 10d6 damage of the appropriate energy type. A character can use this ability as long as her power point reserve is 13 or more.</p>

	<p>When activating this ability, the kineticist can infuse the breath weapon with additional psionic energy, increasing the damage done by +1d6 points per power point spent. The total amount of energy spent infusing the attack cannot exceed your level of kineticist (maximum damage 20d6). The defender may make a Fortitude save (DC 1d20 + 1/2 manifester level + key ability modifier) for half damage. This increased damage value lasts for a single attack.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Energy Walk</em> (Sp):</strong> Beginning at 6th level, the kineticist can use this ability to literally walk on air. She can move at her normal speed in all directions, including vertically, but cannot move more than double her normal speed in a round. Once activated, this ability lasts for 10 minutes per level of kineticist. The kineticist leaves energy footprints in the air that disperse in 2 rounds, although the tread does not deal damage. She can stop moving in mid-air and hover for up to 2 rounds before needing to move again. The kineticist can jump while using <em>energy walk</em>; however, distance traveled is counted toward movement for that round as usual. She must pay 3 power points to use the <em>energy walk</em> ability.</p>

	<p>When activating this ability, the kineticist can infuse the ability with additional psionic energy, increasing her movement to double normal speed at a cost of 2 power points.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Nimbus</em> (Sp):</strong> At 7th level, the kineticist can activate this ability as a move-equivalent action. Her entire body is surrounded by psionic energy that harms neither her nor her equipment. While activated, the character&#39;s key ability modifier (not score) increases by +2 and she gains damage reduction 3/&#8212;. She is also treated as though her entire body is affected by the energized touch special ability, and coming in contact with the kineticist does 1d6 points of damage of the appropriate energy type. Weapons she holds are treated as though affected by the <em>energize weapon</em> special ability. She can also use the energy walk special ability for free while affected by <em>nimbus</em>, though she must still pay the additional 2 power points to double her speed. She must pay 7 power points each minute that she uses the <em>nimbus</em> ability.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Energy Death</em> (Sp):</strong> At 9th level, the kineticist gains the ability to affect a single creature or object within 100 feet by generating a kinetic effect within it of her energy type. Against creatures this affects the blood and internal organs to cause a lethal effect. The target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (1d20 + 1/2 manifester level + key ability modifier) or die horrifically. Even on a successful save, the target sustains 3d8 points of damage of the appropriate energy type. The kineticist must pay 15 power points each time she uses this ability.</p>

	<p>Nonliving objects of up to 10 cubic feet take 3d8 points of damage of the appropriate energy type from the attack. Objects take half damage from acid-, fire-, and electricity-based attacks. Divide the damage by 2 before applying the hardness. Cold attacks deal one-quarter damage to objects. Sonic attacks deal full damage to objects.</p>

	<p><strong>Energy Lord (Su):</strong> At 10th level, the kineticist gains the ability to become a greater elemental once per day for up to 1 hour. The elemental&#39;s energy type and subtype are altered to match the kineticist&#39;s chosen type of energy. The kineticist gains the elemental&#39;s extraordinary abilities and statistics (including hit points); however, she retains her key ability score (if a psion). She also retains all of her own feats, skills, spell-like and supernatural abilities, as well as her ability to manifest psionic powers. Her new ability scores may affect skills and other abilities. The kineticist and her equipment are unharmed by her new body for the duration (and immune to all damage from the appropriate energy type from other sources). A character must maintain a power point reserve of at least 21 to use this ability.</p>

	<h4>Energy Lord Types</h4>

	<p><strong>Acid Lord:</strong> An acid lord is forbidden from entering water or any other liquid except acid.<br /><strong>Cold Lord:</strong> A cold lord cannot enter water but can walk on the surface of the water, which causes 5 cubic feet of water to instantly freeze beneath their feat; they cannot otherwise enter liquids.<br /><strong>Electricity Lord:</strong> An electricity lord is forbidden from entering water or any other liquid.<br /><strong>Fire Lord:</strong> A fire lord cannot enter water or any other nonflammable liquid. A body of water is an impassable barrier unless the fire elemental can step or jump over it.<br /><strong>Sonic Lord:</strong> A sonic lord is forbidden from entering areas affected by silence.</p>

	<h4>Energy Lord Subtypes</h4>

	<p><strong>Acid Subtype (Ex):</strong> Acid immunity, double damage from electricity except on successful save, half damage on a successful save.<br /><strong>Cold Subtype (Ex):</strong> Cold immunity, double damage from fire except on a successful save, half damage on a successful save.<br /><strong>Electricity Subtype (Ex):</strong> Electricity immunity, double damage from acid except on a successful save, half damage on a successful save.<br /><strong>Fire Subtype (Ex):</strong> Fire immunity, double damage from cold except on a successful save, half damage on a successful save.<br /><strong>Sonic Subtype (Ex):</strong> Sonic immunity. All abilities based on sonic energy cease to function in an area of <em>silence</em> provided you fail the Will save. You may attempt the save to negate the silence, if centered on you, each round. If you succeed within the duration of the energy lord ability, you return to that form.</p>
