        <td title="One of your ancestors was a creature of elemental air. Beings associated with this element come in an almost endless variety and your characteristics might vary with the type of elemental creature from which you descend. Regardless of your exact ancestry, you are likely to have blue eyes and wild, unkempt hair.

The descendants of cloud giants tend to be tall, loud, and often arrogant, but they have a strong appreciation
for beauty. Characters with storm giant ancestors, on the other hand, tend toward gentleness and tolerance, but they can display violent tempers when provoked. Descendants of elemental flying creatures display a predatory nature in their movements and behavior, always preferring to keep the advantage of height and distance when dealing with others. Dust mephits produce skinny, morbid descendants; air mephits pass along their lively nature; and ice mephits lend their aloof and distant manner to posterity.

Restless and moody, sorcerers with the Air Bloodline feat often adventure just to move. They might seem apathetic at times, but they can surprise others with quick emotional displays. Such characters tend to be impatient when others want to be still, and they enjoy spending long periods of time in debate.">One of your ancestors was a creature of elemental air. ...</td>

        <td title="You are descended from a chaotic outsider. The characteristics you display might depend in part on the kind of chaotic heritage you have. Regardless of your exact ancestry, you are likely to have one or more unusual physical traits, such as mismatched eyes or untamable and strangely hued hair.

The descendants of demons tend to have misshapen features and a terrible temper with a decidedly cruel streak. Eladrin descendants tend to have strong emotional reactions (especially positive emotions) and often become fervent (if short-term) supporters of a cause. Characters with slaad ancestry generally have strongly variable mood swings, and they often take on the personality traits, speech patterns, and clothing styles of those around them in a haphazard and unpredictable manner. Those with titan blood often stand head--and-shoulders above other members of their race; they enjoy experiencing the world around them and become angry when others might merely be bored.

Characters with the Anarchic Bloodline feat are nearly always chaotic-aligned. They tend to be restless, desiring change above all else. They are prone to act irrationally, based on sudden whims and flights of fancy. The adventurous life, full of excitement, danger, and travel, appeals to them. Chaos-blooded characters often have a wide variety of spells in their repertoire from all schools and for all manner of uses. They rarely focus their spells around a theme or with a specific function in mind.">You are descended from a chaotic outsider. The characteristics you ...</td>

        <td><a href="../../dragon-compendium--109/axiomatic-bloodline--3334/index.html">Axiomatic Bloodline</a></td>
        <td title="You are descended from a native of a lawful plane. The most common members of this bloodline are the
spawn of devils, who sow their seed in the Material Plane as part of far-reaching and complex plots against their rivals. Archons create mixed-blood offspring with mortals in order to counter the machinations of devils and other evil outsiders. Rarely, mortal travelers who spend a significant portion of their lives in a lawfully aligned plane begin to take on some of the traits of that plane that later manifest in their descendants.

Members of this bloodline are almost exclusively lawful. They seem driven by an inner set of rules that generally work in accordance with the laws of the land. They tend to have a symmetrical appearance, dress conservatively, and stick to a regimented life. Even when adventuring, they follow their routine to the best of their ability. Creatures descended from devils tend to use rules for their benefit, manipulating the system and taking advantage of legal loopholes. Descendants of archons practice the gentler aspects of regimen, living lives in as organized a fashion as possible.

Characters with the Axiomatic Bloodline feat tend to be organized and consistent; they generally look down on abnormality or spontaneity. As such, those with lawful blood excel at spells that locate items and creatures as well as spells that return things to their proper place or shape.">You are descended from a native of a lawful plane. ...</td>

        <td title="One of your distant ancestors was a good outsider. The characteristics you display might depend in part on the kind of celestial heritage you have.

Descendants of devas or archons tend to be very decisive--quick to judge and quick to act. Characters
with couatl or lillend ancestors are often physically beautiful, and they tend to favor snakes and other reptiles as familiars. The most common sources of celestial blood, however, are minor good deities or the avatars of more powerful beings. A sorcerer descended from such a line can be very passionate about his faith, whether he follows his ancestor&#39;s religion or not.

Characters with the Celestial Bloodline feat are usually good-aligned, although not always. Their yearning for adventure stems either from a desire to aid others, an innate need to combat evil, or both. As such, celestial- blooded characters tend to focus their spell selections on good- or neutral-aligned spells that aid others.">One of your distant ancestors was a good outsider. The ...</td>

Your characteristics might vary with the type of dragon from which you are descended, but you share some traits with others of draconic blood. Like your majestic reptilian ancestor, you are proud and of noble bearing, and you might even share its coloration in some way.

Although characters with draconic blood can have any alignment, they are prone to mimic their dragon ancestor&#39;s personalities. Others often see them as somewhat arrogant and obsessive, but the dragon- blooded usually feel justifiably proud of their abilities. Spellcasters with draconic ancestors love knowledge and beautiful items, and they often adventure to acquire one or the other. Their spell selections tend toward either flamboyant, combat-oriented spells, or knowledge- gathering spells. Sorcerers of this bloodline favor the same environments as their dragon ancestors.">You are descended from a dragon. The dragon bloodline is ...</td>

Stone giants produce long, lean descendants who tend to be shy but playful. The progeny of earth mephits are generally stubborn, while those of salt mephits are often gifted with a sarcastic wit. Characters with gargoyle blood tend to be territorial and prone to violence, especially when it comes to protecting what is theirs.

Some would say that sorcerers with the Earth Bloodline feat are unchanging, but this assessment is not entirely true. Rather, they are slow to change--not to mention tough, determined, and unwavering in their goals. They generally enjoy being underground, so they like to delve into dungeons and other subterranean locales.">You are descended from a creature of elemental earth. Your ...</td>

The heirs of dryads are often quite shy but they possess quick minds and an earthy beauty. Grig-blooded characters are mischievous and lighthearted, while those with pixie blood are prone to take their pranks too far. Characters with nixie blood are suspicious beings who tend to avoid strangers but remain fiercely loyal to places or persons they love.

Sorcerers with fey blood often have changing, fickle natures. They are quick to laugh and play tricks, but slow to forgive or forget slights. They adventure primarily out of a sense of alienation, seeking some place or group to which they can belong. They are fond of spells that deceive and manipulate emotions, such as charm person.">One of your ancestors was a fey creature, or was ...</td>

bloodline are dark in coloration, although great variation can exist depending on your specific ancestry.
Evil outsiders such as demons and devils produce a surprisingly large number of offspring on the Material Plane. Their descendants are frequently (but not always) evil. Demon-blooded characters and others descended from beings native to the chaotic evil realms are usually chaotic themselves, and at their worst they can be prone to greedy or lustful behavior.

Those with devil blood, on the other hand, tend to be lawful. They have no compunctions about bending the rules as far as possible, but they rarely break them. Like their fiendish ancestors, devil-spawn are known for keeping their word.

Characters with fiendish blood often seem driven-- even haunted--by the potential for evil within them, especially if they try to hold to a neutral or good path. They frequently adventure out of a restlessness caused by their own internal struggles, although sometimes they do so simply because they enjoy killing and adventuring provides a perfect outlet for that tendency. Such characters usually prefer spells of darkness and deception, even if they are good-aligned.">One of your distant ancestors was an evil outsider. The ...</td>

The descendants of azers see fire as a tool, and they love crafts that control the power of flame. They tend to prefer a regimented life and usually keep their destructive natures in tight check, although they are no less dangerous because of that forbearance. The descendants of fire mephits have a mischievous nature and enjoy destructive pranks, while characters with steam mephits in their ancestry consider themselves above such behavior and often look down on others with considerable arrogance. Fire giant spawn can be ruthless in achieving their goals, and even others with fire blood see them as brutal. None, however, can be as cruel as the descendants of salamanders.

Usually hot-tempered and unpredictable, characters with the Fire Bloodline feat can also be passionate, egotistical, and unusually prone to destructive behavior. They usually adventure for a chance at personal gain and glory. Fire holds a primal fascination and fear for most creatures, and scions of this bloodline use that to their advantage, often choosing mind-affecting spells to supplement their preferred destructive flame spells.">One ofyour ancestors was a creature of elemental fire.

Your physical characteristics might vary depending on the type ofundead creature from which you are descended, but you&#39;re likely to have pale or ashen skin and dark eyes and hair. The touch of undeath in a family almost exclusively comes from intelligent, corporeal undead. It takes powerful magic or extremely bizarre situations for creatures to gain this feat from unintelligent or incorporeal undead. The descendants of ghouls tend to be feral and constantly hungry. Those with ghast ancestors generally have a strong, unpleasant stench, and they often find it difficult to satiate their hunger. Lich-blooded characters value intelligence and generally have elitist personalities, often appearing gaunt and skeletal. Characters descended from mummies tend to have dull but focused personalities, and many have gaunt, dry skin. Descendants of vampires tend to have long canine teeth and commanding, seductive personalities. Wight-blooded characters tend to have clawlike fingernails and toenails, and lean, muscular bodies; they are generally hate-filled loners who hold grudges. Characters with the Necromantic Bloodline feat often favor wearing the blacks, whites, and grays of mourning.

Sorcerers with a touch of the undead in their family trees tend to concentrate, appropriately enough, on spells from the school of necromancy. Spells that allow the caster to control a creature&#39;s mind are popular among those descended from vampires.">One of your ancestors was an undead creature or possessed ...</td>
